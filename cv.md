# About Me
I give 100% of myself at work, and when I come home, I give 100% to my family. I believe in showing up fully, wherever I am.

I don’t view challenges as problems. For me, they are tasks that need the right approach to prevent them from becoming problems.

I’m convinced that a strong team amplifies the potential of each individual — collaboration turns ability into achievement.

# Code Example
```
let sum = (a, b) =>
  Number.isFinite(a) && Number.isFinite(b)
    ? a + b
    : "One or two parameters are not a number!";

console.log(sum([], 40));        // => "One or two parameters are not a number!"
console.log(sum("50", 40));      // => "One or two parameters are not a number!"
console.log(sum(NaN, 40));       // => "One or two parameters are not a number!"
console.log(sum(50, 40));        // => 90
```
